I stopped switching languages every new day, from day 10, because... sanity?
The goal still holds tho (with languages not already used [last year](https://github.com/dougy147/aoc2023)). Expect translations someday.

Hardest days (descending order):

- Day 24 (part two)
- Day 17 (part two)
- Day 21 (part two)
