My solutions to 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) event. Still not the best solutions, but still mine.

We'll see where that goes.
Starting again with _one day, one language_.

The goal still holds tho (with languages not already used [last year](https://github.com/dougy147/aoc2023)). Expect translations someday.
